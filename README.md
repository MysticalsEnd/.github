Hi, I'm MysticalsEnd. I don't like giving out my real name online, so just call me Mystical or Myst.
I like doing software development and gaming.
The development part of software development means making things easier to navigate and use, as I don't know CSS, JavaScript, or Python, yet. (True as of 5/24/23, 2:40 AM EST).
Good bye
